# Razorpay-Website-Clone
 Create a clone of the Razorpay website involves several steps and considerations, primarily focused on understanding the functionality, design, and architecture of the original site. This code is a replica of the Razorpay website created to demonstrate the creator's skills in HTML and Tailwind CSS.
This project contain different type of sections, div, articles, etc. to defines the different container in code or Generic container element.

ðŸ”´Heading Section:
The heading section includes the header of the webpage, which typically contains the logo, navigation menu, and possibly some introductory text.
It contains the branding logo on the left side (in this case, Razorpay).
The navigation menu appears on the right side, consisting of links such as "Payment," "Banking," "CorporateCard," etc., presumably representing different services or sections of the website.
There are also buttons for "Log in" and "Sign up" placed on the right side of the header for user authentication actions.
Using img tag to insert the image.
The design is responsive, with certain elements hidden or displayed based on the screen size.

ðŸŸ¡Razorpay Payment Suite Section:
In this section I used flex to arrange the information and image in one line. Flexbox allows you to easily align elements horizontally within a container. 
Create the list to of feature highlights represented by multiple list items (<li> elements) within an unordered list (<ul>).
Each list item highlights a specific feature of the product or service being promoted on the webpage.
Use button tag to create the "Sign Up Now" and "Know More".

ðŸŸ¢6 Box Section:
For this grid layout containing multiple boxes, each representing a "Payment Links" section. Each box will have an image, a title, a description, and a "Know More" link (Reusability of code).
An image displayed at the top by using img tag.
A title ("Payment Links") followed by a description.
A "Know More" link at the bottom.
The styling of the boxes will include borders, spacing, and hover effects to enhance the visual appeal and interactivity

Here I use the bg-url to insert the bg image and reuse the second section as well as the 6 box section code which make it more eassier to build the clone of website.

In section grid is get used to arrange the data in horizantal and verticle manner.
Reuse the code in every box of the grid.

The first section has a title, a divider, and a brief description.
The second section consists of an image which is get moved used transition in css by using keyframes.
